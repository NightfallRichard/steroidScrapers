## Overview

The **steroidScrapers** repository is structured to provide a suite of scraping tools, each located in its respective directory. This modular approach allows users to select and deploy the scraper that best fits their specific requirements.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Each scraper operates independently, allowing for targeted data extraction.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized to handle large datasets with minimal resource consumption.
- **Customization**: Easily configurable settings to adapt to various scraping needs.
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms to manage exceptions and ensure continuous operation.
- **Data Storage**: Supports multiple data storage options, including local files and databases.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
steroidScrapers/
├── scraper-on-steroids/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── scraper.py
│   └── ...
└── simple-scraper/
    ├── README.md
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── scraper.py
