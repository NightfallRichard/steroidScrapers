# Human-Like Web Scraper

This repository contains a Python-based web scraper designed to mimic human-like behavior to reduce detection. The scraper utilizes randomized headers, human-like delays, and simulated mouse movements. It uses [crawl4ai](https://github.com/your-org/crawl4ai) for crawling and an LLM extraction strategy for parsing table data into JSON.

> **Disclaimer:** Bypassing anti-scraping measures may violate a website's terms of service and applicable laws. Use this script responsibly and only on websites you are authorized to scrape.

## Features

- **Randomized Headers & User Agents:** Rotates user agents and request headers to simulate a real browser.
- **Human-Like Delays:** Adds random delays between actions to mimic natural browsing.
- **Script Injection:** Simulates mouse movement to reduce automation fingerprint.
- **Proxy Support:** Uses proxy configuration for added anonymity.
- **LLM-Based Data Extraction:** Extracts table data into JSON using an LLM extraction strategy.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** package manager
 ```
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-like-web-scraper.git
   cd human-like-web-scraper
  

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**

   Make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   _Note:_ If the `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install the necessary packages manually:

   ```bash
   pip install crawl4ai pydantic asyncio
   ```

## Configuration

- **URL_TO_SCRAPE:**  
  Update the `URL_TO_SCRAPE` variable in your script to the target website.

- **Proxy Configuration:**  
  Modify the `proxy_config` dictionary with your proxy details:
  
  ```python
  proxy_config = {
      "server": "http://your-proxy-server:port",
      "username": "your_username",
      "password": "your_password",
  }
  ```

- **LLM Extraction Strategy:**  
  Update the extraction settings such as `provider`, `instruction`, and LLM parameters as needed.

## Usage

To run the scraper, simply execute the Python script:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

The script will:

- Wait for a random delay.
- Inject a simulated mouse movement script.
- Crawl the target URL.
- Extract table data and print the JSON output.

## GitHub Actions & CI

If you want to run tests or automate deployments with GitHub Actions, add a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run scraper
      run: python your_script.py
```
